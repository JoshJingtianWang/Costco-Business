__Abstract:__

As a wholesaler, Costco excels in selling large quantities of selected goods at a cheap price, and because of that, Costco’s shelf space cannot accommodate a large selection of brands. Costco needs to efficiently allocate its limited shelf space to goods specific to the regions of the United States. Particularly, Costco is interested in tapping into the work-from-home (WFH) market and wants to know which region/demographic of the US has an emerging WFH population.

__Design:__

My work will inform Costco on which region of the US they should build new warehouses in, and in the existing warehouses, which ones they should adjust their catalog to accommodate the WFH customers. Adjusting warehouse location and catalog for the WFH customers will help reduce Costco’s shipping cost and attract more customers.
